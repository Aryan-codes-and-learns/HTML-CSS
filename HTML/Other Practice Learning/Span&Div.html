        <p>Shrek is a lovable green ogre who lives in a swamp and values his privacy. Despite his gruff exterior, he has a kind heart and forms deep friendships with Donkey and Princess Fiona. Shrekâ€™s adventures teach important lessons about acceptance, love, and the importance of being true to oneself.</p>

        <div style = "background-color: greenyellow; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">
            <h2>This is a div section</h2>
            <p>Divs are used to group block-elements to format them with CSS. Divs are very useful for layout purposes. A div is a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.</p>
